# Critical Fixes Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the critical fixes implemented based on the judges' review table and external analysis.

## ðŸš¨ MOST CRITICAL UPDATE (December 2024)

### SmolVLA Shape Mismatch Bug Fix
**Issue**: LeRobot v0.4.0 has a critical bug causing shape mismatch errors with latest SmolVLA weights
**Root Cause**: PR #1260 fixed padding removal AFTER v0.4.0 was released
**Fix Applied**: Updated ALL installations from `@v0.4.0` to `@main` to include the fix
**Impact**: Without this fix, RecycloBot crashes with `RuntimeError: Sizes of tensors must match`

## âœ… Completed Fixes

### 1. LeRobot Version (CRITICAL - UPDATED!)
**Issue**: v0.4.0 not on PyPI AND has critical shape mismatch bug
**Fix Applied**: 
- Changed from `@v0.4.0` to `@main` everywhere
- Now using: `lerobot @ git+https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot.git@main`
- Files updated: ALL installation files and documentation
- Rationale: Main branch includes PR #1260 fix for SmolVLA compatibility

### 2. Model Weights Consistency (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Issue**: Inconsistent model references (koch_aloha vs smolvla_base)
**Fix Applied**:
- Changed all `lerobot/koch_aloha` references to `lerobot/smolvla_base`
- Files updated: examples/run_recyclobot_demo.py, scripts/collect_recyclobot_dataset_v3.py, README.md, SETUP_GPU_SIMULATION.md
- Note: scripts/evaluate_recyclobot.py already used the correct model

### 3. PyTorch CUDA Installation (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Issue**: Missing conda command for PyTorch installation
**Fix Applied**:
- Added conda installation option to README.md
- Command: `conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia`
- Kept pip option as alternative

### 4. Camera Index Discovery (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Issue**: No clear documentation on finding camera index
**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced camera troubleshooting section in README.md
- Added multiple methods: LeRobot finder, OpenCV test, v4l2 tools
- Included examples of using --robot-overrides parameter

### 5. Error Handling (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Issue**: Need graceful fallbacks for missing dependencies
**Fix Applied**:
- Added import checks with helpful error messages in run_recyclobot_demo.py
- Checks for: NumPy, PyTorch, Pillow, RecycloBot modules
- Already had good error handling for planners and robot connections

### 6. State Dimensions Documentation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Issue**: Unclear if 14 dimensions are correct for SO-101
**Fix Applied**:
- Added detailed robot configuration section in README.md
- Documented state vector structure: 7 positions + 7 velocities
- Clarified action space: 6 joint commands + 1 gripper command

### 7. Mock Environment Camera Key (From External Analysis)
**Issue**: Mock used `observation.images.main_camera` instead of `observation.images.top`
**Fix Applied**: Updated mock environment to use correct key

### 8. Python Version Consistency (From External Analysis)
**Issue**: setup.py had `>=3.8` but README recommends 3.10
**Fix Applied**: Updated to `>=3.10` everywhere for consistency

## ðŸ“‹ Verification Checklist

- [x] All LeRobot installations use main branch (includes PR #1260)
- [x] SmolVLA uses `lerobot/smolvla_base` model consistently
- [x] PyTorch CUDA installation documented with conda
- [x] Camera index discovery methods documented
- [x] Import error handling added for core dependencies
- [x] State dimensions clearly documented as 14 (7Ã—2)
- [x] Mock environment uses correct observation keys
- [x] Python version consistent (>=3.10)
- [x] Shape mismatch bug fixed by using main branch

## ðŸš€ Ready for Judges

The codebase is now consistent and ready for evaluation with:
- LeRobot from main branch (fixes critical bug)
- Proper model weights (smolvla_base)
- Clear installation instructions
- Comprehensive error handling
- All compatibility issues resolved

**Critical**: Always use `git+https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot.git@main` for installation!
